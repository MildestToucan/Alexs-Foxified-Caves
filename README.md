Alex's Foxified Caves
=======
by GauntRecluse, original mod by AlexModGuy  

This is the repository for GauntRecluse's attempt at forward porting Alex's Caves to NeoForge and 1.21.1  

## Why?  
Because Alex's Caves and its sister projects are, as far as I'm aware, not planned to be ported anytime soon.  
So, I decided to make this mod, because you're best served by yourself, as the French saying goes.  

### A note about Citadel  
Citadel, the library mod used by Alex's Caves, is, I find, a herculean task to just go and port, and it is loaded with certain features that 
will not be used by Alex's Caves. This repository will have its partial recreation of Citadel under a dedicated folder.  
In the event that the partial port of Citadel gains a lot of weight, or that a demand for a dedicated port arises, it'll be separated into its own project.  

### Is this allowed?
Alex's Caves is licensed under the LGPL v3.0 license, which this project will also be licensed under.  
This allows ports and redistributions of modified versions of the project, given the same license is used.  

### Will this be different from the original?  
Changes will need to be made internally to adapt to the loader and version jump, however, this port plans to be as true to 
the original as it can be.
